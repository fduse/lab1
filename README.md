## Attention: This branch "dev" is for development.
Every time there is a new feature to work on or a bug to be fixed,

A **new temporary branch** should be created for this **feature/bug**.

Once the work on this branch is done(including passing tests), it should be **merged** into dev branch and **deleted**.

Every time a new version is about to come out(e.g: several features have been implemented), "dev" should be merged into "master".
